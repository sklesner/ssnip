All warfare is based on deception.
If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.
If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
If his forces are united, separate them.
Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.
He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.
He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.
In war, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.
Know thyself and know thy enemy; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated.
When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal.
If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle.
The skillful warrior avoids the battle.
The ultimate excellence is breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without even having to fight.
For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill.
To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.
If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.
Speed is the essence of war.
Swift as the wind; quiet as the forest; conquer like the fire; steady as the mountain.
Use the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.
There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.
Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.
He who wishes to fight must first count the cost.
He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious.
He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.
He who relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall perish.
Mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy.
Take advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness; travel by unexpected routes and strike him where he has taken no precautions.
Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.
Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: recklessness, cowardice, hasty temper, delicacy of honor, and over-solicitude for his men.
To fight and conquer in all our battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.
Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.
For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.
Thus, an army without its baggage train is lost; without provisions, it is lost; without bases of supply, it is lost.
By reinforcing every portion of his force, will prove superior in practically every point of the engagement.
Strategic advantages can be increased by knowledge, thorough preparation, and the ability to adapt quickly to shifting circumstances.
War is a matter of vital importance to the state; a matter of life or death, the road either to safety or to ruin.
Use spies to gather intelligence, and never be without proper information regarding the enemy's condition.
Military strategy should adapt to the circumstances of the battlefield, taking advantage of the enemy's weaknesses and exploiting them decisively.
The skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without defect, captures their cities without laying siege, and conquers their state without protracted operations.
Regard your soldiers as children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.
When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.
Move swift as the wind and closely-formed as the wood; attack like the fire and be still as the mountain.
Essentials of victory include having a strategic superiority and advantage, knowing the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, the terrain, the conditions of the battlefield, and managing resources effectively.
