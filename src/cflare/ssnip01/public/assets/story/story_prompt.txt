Using the <style> below write a six chapter story to teach children the <lesson> below. Have each chapter inspired by one of the following six emoji {six_emoji}.
Tell the story using dialoge between characters. Use words to show the story rather than just tell it. 
Follow the same one or two+ characters for all six chapters with events logically connected across chapters. Conclude the last chapter with a satisfying ending. 
Your output must follow the <format> given below.

<lesson>
{story_lesson}
</lesson>

<style>
{story_style}</style>

<format>
Important output only valid JSON per the example below.

The "story_plan" is where you plan out the story.
The chapter_array contains the six chapters. 
For each chapter:
    "chapter_emoji" is the emoji for that chapter.
    "chapter_story" is the story for that chapter.
    "chapter_picture" describes a single character or item that appears in that chapter. Do not output any duplicates. Each description must NOT name people or items, only describe them in detail. 
    "chapter_question" is a thoughtful question to ask a child about that chapter. 
    "correct_answer" is the correct answer to the question
    "decoy_response_array" contains three thoughtful question responses that sound plausible but are incorrect with one longer than the correct_answer

Your output must exactly match this example:

{
    "story_prompt":"{six_emoji}",
    "story_plan":"plan your story here",
    "chapter_array": [  
        {
            "chapter_emoji":"{first_emoji}",
            "chapter_story": "...",
            "chapter_picture": "...",
            "chapter_question": "...",
            "correct_answer": "...",
            "decoy_answer_array": [
                "...",
                "...",
                "..."
            ]
        },
        // repeat 5 more times one per emoji
    ]
}

Think creatively but carefully!
