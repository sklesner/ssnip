Archie stood proudly in his kitchen, dusted with flour, ready to create the world's greatest pizza. He piled on everything he loved‚Äîstrawberries, marshmallows, even pickles‚Äîand ignored his friend Milo's warning that perhaps he should reconsider. When the oven dinged, Archie pulled out his masterpiece, only to find it had melted into a gloopy mess that stuck to the pan like glue. Still, he grinned, pretending it was perfect, until the cheese began to bubble over the edges, dripping onto the floor, and set off the fire alarm.

<decoy>He believed Milo was trying to sabotage his pizza-making efforts.</decoy>

<decoy>Archie wanted to make a pizza so unique that it didn't matter what others thought.</decoy>

<decoy>He didn't hear Milo's advice because the kitchen was too noisy.</decoy>

Archie, still determined to prove himself, visited the zoo next. At the penguin exhibit, he noticed the little birds waddling around and decided that they would enjoy it much more if he rearranged the rocks in their habitat. As he started moving things around, the penguins slid awkwardly into the water, slipping and bumping into each other. A zookeeper gently told Archie that the penguins were perfectly fine with how things were, but Archie waved him off, insisting he knew best. Moments later, one penguin tripped over the misplaced rocks and plopped into a heap of feathers. Archie blinked, unsure what went wrong.

<question>Why did Archie think the penguins needed help with their environment?</question>

<answer>He believed that because he didn't like the way it looked, the penguins wouldn‚Äôt either, even though he knew little about them.</answer>

<decoy>He had read that penguins prefer a perfectly flat surface.</decoy>

<decoy>He thought the zookeeper had made a mistake and was trying to fix it for them.</decoy>

<decoy>He overheard someone say penguins like rearranged spaces and misunderstood the advice.</decoy>

Later that evening, Archie decided to mix up some drinks at a party. Without asking what people liked, he threw random ingredients into a blender‚Äîcabbage juice, mint, and something labeled "super fizz." The concoction smelled odd, but Archie, as confident as ever, poured it into tall glasses and handed them out. One sip, and everyone's faces scrunched up in horror. The fizz exploded out of the cups, soaking the table, the guests, and even the ceiling in green foam. Archie scratched his head, wondering why no one seemed to enjoy his creation.

<question>What went wrong with Archie's drink at the party?</question>

<answer>Archie didn‚Äôt ask anyone for their preferences or feedback before making the drink.</answer>

<decoy>The blender wasn‚Äôt powerful enough to mix the ingredients properly.</decoy>

<decoy>The cups he used were too small, and that‚Äôs why the fizz exploded everywhere.</decoy>

<decoy>Everyone just had bad taste and didn't appreciate Archie's creativity.</decoy>

The next day, Archie encountered a squirrel in the park. The little critter seemed interested in him, twitching its bushy tail and chittering. Some nearby children warned Archie that the squirrel was probably looking for food and would get upset if he tried to pet it. But Archie, certain that he knew better, reached out anyway. In an instant, the squirrel darted up his arm, sending Archie spinning in circles trying to shake it off. Eventually, it leapt away, leaving Archie dizzy and embarrassed, much to the children‚Äôs giggles.

<question>Why did Archie end up spinning in circles after trying to pet the squirrel?</question>

<answer>He ignored the children's advice that the squirrel was looking for food and might not want to be touched.</answer>

<decoy>The squirrel didn‚Äôt like Archie‚Äôs clothes, which made it behave strangely.</decoy>

<decoy>The squirrel thought Archie was another animal and became confused.</decoy>

<decoy>Archie startled the squirrel by moving too fast, causing it to panic.</decoy>

Determined to turn things around, Archie joined a game of chance at the local fair. He watched as people tossed dice to win prizes, but he was sure that his strategy‚Äîtossing the dice with his eyes closed‚Äîwould guarantee success. The others tried to explain how the game really worked, but Archie, stubborn as ever, waved them away. He tossed the dice, and to his horror, they rolled right off the table and into a nearby bucket of paint. Covered in splashes of color, Archie realized his big idea hadn‚Äôt worked out as planned. He sighed, beginning to wonder if perhaps he should‚Äôve listened.

<question>Why did Archie's strategy fail in the dice game?</question>

<answer>He ignored the rules and advice, thinking he could win with his eyes closed, but that led to a mess instead.</answer>

<decoy>The dice were rigged, making it impossible for anyone to win without cheating.</decoy>

<decoy>He didn't realize that using too much force would cause the dice to roll out of control.</decoy>

<decoy>The table was too small, which caused the dice to bounce in the wrong direction.</decoy>

The final straw came when Archie, walking home, slipped on a banana peel. His feet flew out from under him, and he landed flat on his back. This time, an older woman passing by offered him a hand and gently told him that sometimes, it's best to look where you're going and pay attention to the advice others offer. Archie's cheeks flushed red, but he smiled sheepishly and nodded. The next day, he asked Milo for tips on making pizza. This time, when he pulled it from the oven, it was crispy, delicious, and best of all, everyone wanted a slice.

<question>What made Archie finally ask Milo for advice on making pizza again?</question>

<answer>After slipping on the banana peel, he realized that listening to others' advice could help him avoid more mistakes.</answer>

<decoy>He realized that Milo had been sabotaging him all along and needed to make amends.</decoy>

<decoy>The older woman convinced him that only expert advice would make his food better.</decoy>

<decoy>Archie finally understood that Milo‚Äôs pizza-making skills were better than his own.</decoy>
