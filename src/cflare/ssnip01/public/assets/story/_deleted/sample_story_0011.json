You are famous for your stories for young children in the style of Roald Dahl, Edward Gorey and Tim Burton.
Write a story that teaches the following life lesson: "Seek out and accept honest feedback from others."
Do not explicitly say the lesson in words but teach it using scenes written to use a single emoji in this order: 🍕 🐧 🍹 🐿️ 🎲 🍌
Your output must follow the JSON EXAMPLE below. The story_plan is where you plan out the story.
The scene_array contains the six scenes. For each scene:
"scene_emoji" is the emoji for that scene.
"scene_story" is the story for that scene.
"scene_picture" describes a single character or item that appears in that scene.  Each description must be short and must NOT name people or items in the story only describe them. Do not output duplicates. 
"scene_question" is a thoughtful question to ask a child about that scene. 
"correct_answer" is the correct answer to the question
"decoy_response_array" contains three thoughtful question responses that sound plausible but are incorrect. 
Important output only valid JSON per the example below.
