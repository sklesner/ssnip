Write in a style inspired by Roald Dahl:

Embrace whimsy and the absurd: Create fantastical worlds and situations that spark children's imaginations. Don't be afraid to be silly or outlandish.

Use vivid, playful language: Invent creative words and phrases. Play with alliteration, rhymes, and onomatopoeia to make the text come alive.

Create memorable, larger-than-life characters: Develop distinct personalities for your characters, often with exaggerated traits that children can easily grasp and remember.

Include dark humor: Don't shy away from mildly scary or gross elements. Kids often enjoy a bit of darkness mixed with humor.

Empathize with child protagonists: Make your main characters relatable to young readers, often facing adversity from adult antagonists.

Incorporate moral lessons subtly: Weave in themes of kindness, bravery, or honesty without being heavy-handed.

Use rich, detailed descriptions: Paint vivid pictures with words to fully immerse readers in your story's world.

Keep the plot fast-paced: Maintain excitement and interest with plenty of action and quick turns of events.

Add unexpected twists: Surprise your readers with plot developments they didn't see coming.

Include adults as either comically inept or menacing figures: This appeals to children's sense of superiority or their fears about grown-ups.
