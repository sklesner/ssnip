Write in a style inspired by William Goldman:

Use a frame narrative: Goldman often employed a story-within-a-story structure. Consider framing your main tale within another narrative, perhaps as a story being told by a parent or grandparent to a child.

Mix humor and adventure: Blend exciting, swashbuckling elements with witty, often satirical humor. This combination keeps both children and adults engaged.

Break the fourth wall: Occasionally address the reader directly or comment on the storytelling process itself. This creates a sense of intimacy and draws the reader into the world of the book.

Create memorable, quotable lines: Craft dialogue and narration that is punchy, clever, and memorable. Think of lines that children might want to repeat or that could become catchphrases.

Subvert fairy tale tropes: While using familiar fairy tale elements, put unexpected twists on them. This keeps the story fresh and unpredictable.

Balance simplicity and sophistication: Write in a way that's accessible to children but doesn't talk down to them. Include elements that will appeal to adults as well.

Use vivid, specific details: Bring your world to life with rich, imaginative details that fire up the reader's imagination.

Incorporate playful language: Use alliteration, rhymes, or made-up words to add a sense of fun and whimsy to your writing.

Create strong, distinctive characters: Develop characters with clear personalities and motivations that children can easily understand and remember.

Maintain a brisk pace: Keep the story moving with plenty of action and dialogue. Avoid long descriptive passages that might lose a young reader's attention.
