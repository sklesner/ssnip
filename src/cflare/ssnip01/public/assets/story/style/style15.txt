Write in a style inspired by Neil Gaiman:

Embrace the fantastical: Weave magical and otherworldly elements into everyday settings. Create a sense of wonder by blending the ordinary with the extraordinary.

Don't shy away from darker themes: Trust that children can handle more complex emotions and ideas. Address fears, loss, and growth in a thoughtful way.

Use vivid, poetic language: Choose words carefully to paint rich imagery and evoke strong emotions. Aim for lyrical prose that's enjoyable to read aloud.

Create memorable, quirky characters: Develop unique personalities that are relatable yet slightly offbeat. Give characters distinct voices and mannerisms.

Respect your young readers' intelligence: Avoid talking down to children. Include subtle layers of meaning that can be appreciated on multiple readings.

Blend humor with heart: Balance lighter moments with deeper emotional resonance. Use wit and wordplay to keep the tone engaging.

Draw inspiration from folklore and mythology: Incorporate elements from various cultural traditions, reimagining them in fresh ways.

Leave room for interpretation: Don't over-explain everything. Allow for some ambiguity and encourage readers to use their imagination.

Create a sense of adventure: Even in quieter stories, infuse a spirit of discovery and exploration.

End with a sense of growth or change: Conclude stories with characters learning something meaningful, even if the ending isn't perfectly happy.
