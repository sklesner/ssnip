Use rich, descriptive language: Bellairs had a talent for vivid descriptions that brought his spooky settings to life. Focus on sensory details to immerse readers in your story's world.

Balance scary elements with humor: While Bellairs' books could be creepy, he often included moments of levity. Sprinkle in some humor to offset the scarier parts of your story.

Incorporate puzzles or mysteries: Many of Bellairs' books featured protagonists solving puzzles or uncovering secrets. Include elements that encourage readers to think and deduce alongside the characters.

Create unique, memorable adult characters: Bellairs often included eccentric adult characters who aided the young protagonists. Develop interesting adult figures that complement your main characters.
