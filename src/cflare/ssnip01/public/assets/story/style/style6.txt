Write in a style inspired by C.S. Lewis:

Use rich, vivid descriptions to bring fantastical worlds to life. Paint mental pictures with words, focusing on sensory details.

Blend the ordinary with the extraordinary. Anchor magical elements in familiar, relatable contexts to make them more accessible to young readers.

Create multi-layered stories that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. Include deeper themes and allegories beneath the surface narrative.

Develop complex, believable characters that grow and change throughout the story. Even magical creatures should have relatable personalities and flaws.

Employ a warm, conversational narrative voice that speaks directly to the reader at times, as if telling a story to a child.

Don't shy away from addressing serious topics or darker themes, but present them in a way that's appropriate for children.

Use humor and wit to lighten the mood and keep young readers engaged, especially during more serious moments.

Incorporate elements of myth, folklore, and classic literature, reimagining them in fresh ways.

Balance exciting adventure with quieter, contemplative moments that allow for character development and reflection.

Trust in children's intelligence and ability to grasp complex ideas. Avoid oversimplification or talking down to your audience.

Create a sense of wonder and awe about the world, encouraging curiosity and imagination in young readers.
