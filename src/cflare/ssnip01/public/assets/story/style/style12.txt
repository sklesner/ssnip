Write in a style inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien:

Rich, detailed world-building: Create a vivid, immersive setting with its own history, languages, and cultures. Even if not all details make it into the story, having a deep background enriches the narrative.

Blend familiar and fantastical elements: Incorporate everyday objects and experiences alongside magical or extraordinary elements to make the story relatable yet wondrous.

Use lyrical, descriptive language: Employ evocative prose that paints pictures in the reader's mind, but keep it accessible for younger audiences.

Incorporate songs and poetry: Weave short verses or songs into the narrative to add depth and atmosphere to the story world.

Focus on character growth: Develop protagonists who face challenges and grow throughout their journey, often starting as ordinary individuals who discover their inner strength.

Explore themes of good vs. evil: Present clear moral lessons, but avoid being overly didactic. Allow readers to draw their own conclusions.

Include elements of myth and folklore: Draw inspiration from various mythologies and folk tales to give the story a timeless quality.

Create memorable, whimsical characters: Populate the story with unique beings that capture children's imaginations.

Balance humor and seriousness: Include light-hearted moments and gentle humor alongside more serious themes to keep young readers engaged.

Use repetition and rhythm: Employ recurring phrases or patterns in the narrative to create a sense of familiarity and aid in reading comprehension.
