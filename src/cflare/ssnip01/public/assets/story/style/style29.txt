Write in a style inspired by Calvin and Hobbes:

Focus on capturing a child's imagination and sense of wonder. Create stories that blend everyday childhood experiences with fantastical adventures or daydreams. 

Develop witty, precocious child characters who are clever beyond their years, but still authentically childlike in their emotions and struggles. Give them rich inner lives and vivid imaginations.

Balance humor and heart. Include plenty of silly situations and wordplay, but also moments of genuine emotion and insight into childhood.

Use snappy, natural-sounding dialogue. Let characters' personalities shine through in how they speak.

Don't shy away from bigger words or concepts - trust that children can handle intellectual challenges when presented engagingly.

Incorporate visual humor and physical comedy into your descriptions. Think about how scenes would play out visually.

Address mature themes in age-appropriate ways. Don't talk down to children, but find ways to explore complex ideas through a child's perspective.

Create adult characters who are flawed but still sympathetic. Show the humor in how kids and adults often misunderstand each other.

Use your stories to gently poke fun at societal norms or human nature, as seen through a child's eyes.

Most importantly, maintain a spirit of fun, mischief and adventure throughout. Capture the energy and anything-is-possible feeling of childhood.
